# Linear Regression Machine Learning

Linear regression is one of the simplest and most widely used algorithms in machine learning. It is used for predictive analysis and is a statistical approach for modeling the relationship between a dependent and independent variable. In this blog, we will take a deeper dive into the mathematical intuition behind linear regression, the different types of linear regression, and how to implement it using Python.

# Mathematical Intuition:
The basic idea behind linear regression is to find a line that best fits the given data points. This line is called the regression line and is represented mathematically as y = mx + b, where y is the dependent variable, m is the slope of the line, x is the independent variable, and b is the y-intercept. The goal is to find the values of m and b that minimize the difference between the actual and predicted values of y.
